# Chapter-7: Adding Animation to an App
### What I Learned
I learned how to use Flutter’s animation tools to create dynamic effects. This included working with Tween for defining value transitions and AnimatedBuilder for building animated widgets. I also explored creating smooth navigation transitions and interactive effects like animated buttons.

## Achievement
I developed an app with animated transitions for navigation and added button effects, demonstrating my understanding of Flutter’s animation framework.
